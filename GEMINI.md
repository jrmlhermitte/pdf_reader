# PDF Reader And Annotator

This is a pdf reader and annotator library. The purpose is to allow collecting
pdfs and some metadata (author, publication date, title, summary) to allow
making finding, reading and annotating them easily.


## Structure

There are two main folders:
- backend/: Contains code for the backend server. This is written in python.
- frontend/: Contains code for the frontend server. This is written in react.


## Guidelines
- Don't try running the server yourself. Ask the user to do it.
- Don't use git. The user will periodically commit code as needed.
- Ask the user to install dependencies instead of installing them.
